## Automatic leek image selection

Based on the level of the leek, when a user selects a json build, I should auto select the correct leek size
I should also be able to select a leek color corresponding to the build into (poison = purple, strength = brown etc)

## Small touch

This electron app will be a standalone .exe with

    - A custom icon
    - A custom name

I should be able to configure those two
