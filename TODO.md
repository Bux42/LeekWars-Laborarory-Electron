## Automatic leek image selection

Based on the level of the leek, when a user selects a json build, I should auto select the correct leek size
I should also be able to select a leek color corresponding to the build into (poison = purple, strength = brown etc)

## Small touch

Implement notifications for when a pool run has finished? (it can take a long time depending on the pool)

## Automatic release

On github, I should be able to generate new releases, with a generated installer for the users to use directly
